# Loan-Default-prediction
- Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.
- In this project I have predictive model to predict that a person will be able to pay loan or not. So that bank can target customers that can pay the loan in time.
- In this project I combined data from several tables then I did some preprocessing, and I made multiple models. After that I evaluated all these model with confustion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score AUC RUC. 
- Then finally i concluded which model we can use.
